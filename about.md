I find About pages somewhat difficult to write, so I'll just get straight to the point about how this blog came to be.

I read Scott Lowe's article: [The Story Behind the Migration](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/06/the-story-behind-the-migration/),
I was intrigued and decided to try GitPages for myself.  I was mostly touched by what he said in his article about practicing what he 
preached.  Like him, I also constantly strive to keep up with technology, I think everyone does.  

GitPages helped solve several problems I was having.  

1) I do tend to write alot of code (mostly BASH)
2) It's a pain in the butt trying to maintain version control and backups.  

After looking into Git, it seems to be a perfect fit for me.  I love being able to edit all my posts locally and then pushing the commits to the repository.

The pages are clean and not crowded with adds or nifty widgets (I used to have a WP site).  I also really like how Git formats code snippets!  
I am very satisfied using Git to host both my projects and this blog.  It's pretty much a one-stop-shop.

Like the title of my blog implies, this blog is basically my online scrapbook.  It holds scraps of things that I've learned through
googling, troubleshooting, and just simply trying new/different approaches to solve my problems.  

I know I will refer back to the contents of this blog many times; hopefully you find something that helps you too!
